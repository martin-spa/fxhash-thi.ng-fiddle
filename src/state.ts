/**

 * dependencies, i.e. we treat the various object properties as nodes in a
 * Direct Acyclic Graph (DAG) and their lexical order (in the source code) is
 * irrelevant. This greatly reduces the cognitive overhead when managing more
 * complex state initialization once there's a decent amount of interrelated
 * params & state values in your project:
 *
 * Just add new params/state values (in any order) and, if needed, specify their
 * dependencies (on other state params) as destructured function arguments (see
 * examples below)
 *
 * You should ONLY initialize params/components here which are NOT dependent on
 * dynamic external factors like window size/resolution etc. (which we call
 * "responsive" here). Only non-responsive (static) base config is initialized
 * here and rest handled via {@link resolveState} further below...
